Screamer
========


Screamer is a high-performance Python library for time series analysis, designed for speed, 
accuracy, and versatility in handling both NumPy arrays and streaming data.

Easy to use, and powerfull 
--------------------------

The `3-lines-of-code` example below shows a stream processor that fits a trendline to a sliding 
window of the last 50 values. It then returns the slope of this fitted line. This slope is fed into a 
second stream processor, which outputs the sign of the slope, indicating the trend direction (upward or downward).


.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 6

    from screamer import RollingPoly2, Sign

    slope = RollingPoly2(window_size=50, derivative_order=1)
    sign = Sign()

    result = sign(slope(data))


The plot below shows the input data (top, blue), the slope calculated over the previous 50 samples 
(middle, orange), and the sign of the slope (bottom, red).


.. plotly::
   :include-source: False

    import numpy as np
    import plotly.graph_objects as go
    from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
    from screamer import RollingPoly2, Sign

    # Generate example data
    np.random.seed(0)
    data = np.cumsum(np.random.normal(size=300))

    # Create subplots with specified row heights and shared x-axis
    fig = make_subplots(
        rows=3, cols=1,
        shared_xaxes=True,
        row_heights=[1/3, 1/3, 1/3],
        vertical_spacing=0.02
    )

    # rolling mean
    slope = RollingPoly2(window_size=50, derivative_order=1)

    # sign
    sign = Sign()

    # Add traces for input data and results with different derivative orders
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(y=data, mode='lines', name='data'), row=1, col=1)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(y=slope(data), mode='lines', name='slope(data)', line=dict(color='orange')), row=2, col=1)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(y=sign(slope(data)), mode='lines', name='sign(slope(data))', line=dict(color='red')), row=3, col=1)

    # Update layout with titles and axis labels
    fig.update_layout(
        title=None,
        xaxis3_title="Sample index",
        yaxis=dict(title="Data"),
        yaxis2=dict(title="Moving Average"),
        yaxis3=dict(title="Sign"),
         margin=dict(l=20, r=20, t=20, b=20)  # Adjust left, right, top, and bottom margins        
    )

    fig.show()


Build for speed
---------------

Engineered in C++ with state-of-the-art numerical algorithms, Screamer delivers exceptional 
computational efficiency, consistently outperforming traditional libraries like NumPy and 
Pandas—often by factors of two or more, and in some cases by orders of magnitude.

Streaming- or batch- processing
-------------------------------

Screamer seamlessly handles both batch and streaming data with the same code, producing identical 
results regardless of the data source. This design means that models tested offline on batch 
datasets will perform exactly the same when deployed with live streaming data, providing 
confidence in the consistency and reliability of your results.

Screamer's streaming design ensures that all transformations are naturally free from look-ahead bias, 
guaranteeing accurate and reliable results
